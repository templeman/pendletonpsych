* Final touches on contact form
	* optimize code, remove commented code
	* customize verification icons
* Implement HTML5 tags (especially on article pages)
* Purge old files
* Look into PDFs not retaining all Word doc formatting
* Tailor html metadata
* Add dateline to new articles
* Create print.css
* Look into white border issue on < IE 9 browsers (bottom not always expanding enough)

### Ongoing ###

* Keep an eye on Google+ Local vs Google Places vs Google Plus Pages for Business
* Look to expand layout for more breathing room (maybe experiment with Golden Ratio?)
* Optimize CSS (check for redundant font tags, etc)
* Continue SEO (submit to AOL search; others) *** Submitted to DMOZ.org on 07.17.2012 ***
